If it's successful, it could help doctors and healthcare workers quickly find important patient details, leading to better decisions. This app might also let patients keep track of their own medical history and share it with their doctors. The app will use smart technology to organize reports, which could help doctors understand trends in patients' health. And don't worry, the app will keep all the information safe and private. If it works well, this app could improve how healthcare is done in Nepal, making it more organized and accessible for everyone involved.
